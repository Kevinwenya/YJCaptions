YJ Captions 26k Dataset
=======================
 
We have developed a Japanese version of the MS COCO caption dataset, which we call YJ Captions 26k Dataset.  It is created to facilitate the development of image captioning in Japanese language.  Each Japanese caption describes the specified image provided in [MS COCO dataset]( http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download) and each image has 5 captions. 
 
 
## Annotation Format
 
The annotations are stored using the JSON file format. 
The annotation scheme is the same as that of [MS COCO](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download).  Please see the section on Image Caption Annotations.
